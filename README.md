while working my last job i often had trouble making good commit
messages.

the goal is to create a minimal cli tool which takes in the git diff and adds and commits the changes with a solid commit message

-------------

download: [git-autocommit (pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/git-autocommit/0.1.0/)

usage: running `git-autocommit` on any repository with local changes will add and commit with an LLM-generated message
